Steps for buidling a model:
1. Understand the data :- Best way is to make plots or graphs.
2. Build the model and evaluate the model on that data :- take the randpm sample of the data and check the preformence of the model on rest of the data i.e. one as training set and one as test/validation set.Here various techniques will be used to mathematically establish a relation betweeen predictor and outcome for this training set will be used.Test will only be used when strong candidate models has been establshed.

An alternative approach to check that how well the model operates is to use sampling.


Data Splitting: How to allcoate data to certain tasks is an important aspect of modelling.
		How training and test data sets are determined should reflect how mdoel will be applied.
 		Random samples are always better to take as training data sets.
		Predictor data



Free lunch theorem(Wolpert 1996)  :- Without having substantive information about modelling problem ,there is no single model that will always perform better than any other model.

That's why a wide variety pf techniques are tried before focussing on a single technique.


Aim : Generate a relaiable, trustworthy model for predicting new samples.


To achieve this aim :- First understand the data and objective of modeling, then pre-process and split the data. Only after that we would proceed to building , evualating and selecting the model.
